            <b class="B3">
                Tatsuki Fujimoto is one of the most talented and daring manga artists of his generation. Born on 10 October 1992 in Japan's Akita prefecture, he has established himself as a major figure in contemporary manga thanks to landmark works such as Fire Punch and Chainsaw Man. His ability to fuse dark themes, offbeat humour and raw emotion has won him a worldwide audience.

            <h2>The early days of a promising artist</h2>
        </div>
        <div id="mangaka_text-2">
            <b class="B3">
                From an early age, Fujimoto was interested in drawing and storytelling. Inspired by creators such as Satoshi Kon (Perfect Blue, Paprika) and Hayao Miyazaki (The Voyage of Chihiro), he developed a unique sensibility for visual storytelling. 
                It was with Fire Punch (2016-2018), published in *Shōnen Jump+ magazine, that he made his acclaimed professional debut. This post-apocalyptic work is both violent and philosophically rich, exploring themes such as revenge, survival and the nature of humanity. Although controversial for its graphic violence and disconcerting tone, Fire Punch establishes Fujimoto as a writer to watch.

            <h2>Chainsaw Man: The explosion of a phenomenon</h2>
        </div>
        <div id="mangaka_text-2">
            <b class="B3">
                In 2018, Tatsuki Fujimoto launched Chainsaw Man in the famous Weekly Shōnen Jump magazine. The story of Denji, a poor young man fused with a chainsaw demon dog, immediately captivates readers with its bold narrative and striking graphic style.
                Chainsaw Man stands out for its balance between the absurd and the poignant, black humour and tragedy. Fujimoto explores universal themes such as loneliness, the quest for happiness and redemption, while challenging the conventions of traditional shōnen. The work received rave reviews and became a worldwide success, being adapted into an acclaimed animated series by the MAPPA studio.

                Fujimoto is also known for his love of cinema, which strongly influences his work. His plates often evoke cinematic compositions, with an attention to detail and a mastery of visual rhythms that reinforce the impact of his stories.
